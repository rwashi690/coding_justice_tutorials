# Problem 1

## Task 1
Rosie the dog want to keep track of her dog bones and toys. So she would want a function that would print out the number of bones and toys when given the appropriate number. To complete this task write a function using C in Replit if you are competing in BotBall.

## Task 2
Now that Rosie knows how many dog bones and toys she has she now has another problem. She has dog bones in the bedroom and on the sofa in the living room. She knows how many dog bones she has in each room but she would rather keep them in their respective rooms rather than counting them. She wants you to create a function that will add the bones of the two rooms together. To complete this task write a function using C in Replit if you are competing in BotBall.

## Task 3
Lastly, Rosie wants you to learn if...else statements. To learn this she wants you to write a function that returns true or false. Rosie loves sleeping so if she is sleeping return 'True' if she is not sleeping return 'False. In the function you can use the input 0 for sleeping and 1 for awake.
